    "- Descriptive Stats \n",
    "\n",
    "    After collecting data, one of the first things to do is to graph the data, calculate the mean and get an overview of the distributions of the data.     This is the task of descriptive statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "    definition : \n",
    "    \"The term descriptive statistics covers statistical methods for describing data using statistical characteristics, charts, graphics or tables.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Depending on which question and which measurement scale is available, different key figures, tables and graphics are used for evaluation. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Level of measurement:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The level of measurement of a variable can be either nominal, ordinal or metric. In a nutshell: For nominal variables the values can be differentiated,     for ordinal variables the values can be sorted and for metric scale level the distances between the values can be calculated. Nominal and ordinal variables are also called categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "    <center><img src=\"../../images/level_of_measurement.png\" alt=\"error\" width=\"600\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Different levels of measurement support different statistical analyses. For instance, mean and standard deviation are suitable for metric data. In some     cases, it may be suitable for ordinal data, but only if you know how to interpret the results correctly. And it definitely makes no sense to calculate it for nominal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The level of measurement also tells us which hypothesis tests are possible and determines the most effective type of data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Nominal variables\n",
    "        The nominal measurement scale is the lowest level of measurement in statistics and therefore has the lowest information content. Possible values of     the variables can be distinguished, but a meaningful order is not possible. If there are only two characteristics, such as in the case of gender (male and female), we also speak of dichotomous or binary variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "        -   Only relations \"equal\" and \"unequal\" are possible.\n",
    "        -   No logical ranking of categories.\n",
    "        -   The order of the answer categories is interchangeable.\n",
    "        -   Nominal characteristics with only two expressions are also called \"binary\" or \"dichotomous\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Ordinal variables\n",
    "        The ordinal level of measurement is the next higher level, it also contains nominal information, only with the difference that a ranking can be formed.A classic representative of the ordinal scale are school grades, here a ranking can be formed, but it cannot be said that the distance between A and B is the same as the distance between B and C\n",
    "\n",
    "        -   Next higher scale of measurement.\n",
    "        -   \"Equal\" and \"unequal\", as well as \"greater\" and \"smaller\", can be determined.\n",
    "        -   There is a logical hierarchy of categories.\n",
    "        -   The distances between the numerical values are not equal, i.e. cannot be interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Categorical variables\n",
    "        Variables that have a nominal scale or an ordinal scale are also called categorical variables. In other words, categorical is an umbrella term for variables scaled nominally and ordinally.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Categorical variables can have a limited and usually fixed number of expressions, e.g. country with \"Germany\", \"Austria\", ... or gender with \"female\" and \"male\". It is important, however, that it must be a finite number of categories or groups. The different categories may have a ranking, but must not.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Metric variables\n",
    "        Metric variables have the highest possible level of measurement. With a metric level of measurement, the characteristic values can be compared and sorted and distances between the values can be calculated. Examples would be the weight and age of subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "        -   Highest level of measurement.\n",
    "        -   Creation of rankings possible.\n",
    "        -   \"Equal\" and \"unequal\", as well as \"greater\" and \"smaller\", can also be determined\n",
    "        -   Differences and sums can be formed meaningfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Ratio scale and interval scale\n",
    "        The metric level of measurement can be further subdivided into interval scale and ratio scale. As the name suggests, the values of the ratio scale can be put into a ratio. Thus, a statement like the following can be made: \"One value is twice as large as another\". For this, an absolute zero must be available as a reference.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Example ratio scale:\n",
    "        The time of marathon runners is measured. Here the statement can be made that the fastest runner is twice as fast as the last runner. This is possible because there is an absolute zero point at the beginning of the marathon where all runners start from zero.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Example interval scale:\n",
    "        If, however, the stopwatch is forgotten to start at the start of the marathon and only the differences are measured starting from the fastest runner, the runners cannot be put in proportion. In this case it can be said how big the interval between the runners is (e.g. runner A is 22 minutes faster than runner B), but it cannot be said that runner A ran 20 percent faster than runner B.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Parameters : \n",
    "    Location parameter: Mean value, median, mode, sum\n",
    "    Dispersion parameter: Standard deviation, variance, range\n",
    "    Tables: Absolute, relative and cumulative frequencies\n",
    "    Charts: Histograms, bar charts, box plots, scatter charts, matrix plots\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential Statistics\n",
    "\t\n",
    "The inferential statistics takes a sample from the population, in order to make inferences about the population with this sample. So, the goal of inferential statistics is to infer the unknown parameters of the population from the known parameters of a sample."
