    "\n",
    "**Machine Learning (ML)** is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It develops algorithms that recognize patterns and make decisions based on input data.\n",

    "\n",
    "- ###  <span style=\"color:#28B463\"><b>1. It’s Not Magic</b></span>\n",
    "    ML doesn’t “magically” solve problems. It relies on algorithms that `learn` from data. The output is only as good as the data provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ###  <span style=\"color:#28B463\"><b>2. Needs Quality Data</b></span>\n",
    "    High-quality, relevant data is crucial. Poor data leads to poor results—`garbage in, garbage out`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ###  <span style=\"color:#28B463\"><b>3. It Learns and Adapts</b></span>\n",
    "    ML models learn from training data and adjust parameters (weights) for better predictions. A significant amount of data is needed to train effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ###  <span style=\"color:#28B463\"><b>4. It’s Not Always Perfect</b></span>\n",
    "    ML models don’t always get it right. They improve iteratively but have limits and can produce errors if trained on insufficient or flawed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ###  <span style=\"color:#28B463\"><b>5. Overfitting vs Generalization</b></span>\n",
    "    - **Overfitting**: When a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data, it’s overfitting.\n",
    "    - **Generalization**: A well-trained ML model generalizes patterns from data and performs well on unseen data.\n",

    "    ML cannot solve every problem. It’s limited by the quality of the data and the design of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ####  <span style=\"color:#28B463\"><b>2. ML Always Improves Over Time</b></span>\n",
    "    More data doesn’t always mean better performance. `Poor-quality data` can degrade model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ####  <span style=\"color:#28B463\"><b>3. ML Replaces Human Input</b></span>\n",
